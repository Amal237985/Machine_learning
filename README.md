## Machine Learning Projects

This repository hosts a collection of machine learning projects, each addressing different problems and employing various algorithms. The projects cover the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Techniques range from traditional machine learning algorithms (like linear regression and decision trees) to more advanced methods such as neural networks and ensemble models.
